- "The user must be able to search for a GitHub user handle"
  - Create a form that a user can input a GH username into


- "The search must trigger a call to GitHub's API"
  - Create a function that will make the call. You can make it empty at first.
  - Verify that when the form is submitted the function is called.

  - Proceed to create the function. It should pass the value submitted from the
  form.
    - I don't need to make the call yet actually. Just verify that I have the
    form value.

  - Once I know that the function is receiving the form value begin constructing
  the get URL.
    -https://api.github.com/users/[github-username]/repos


- "The repos associated with that handle must be displayed on the page."
  - In general I'll be taking the JSON response and displaying it using HTML.
    - Specifically I'll need to iterate through the response object. Use a for
    loop like I did with dog API app

    - "You must display the repo name and link to the repo URL."
      - In the iterating block, for each item: display the name of the repo.
      - Hyperlink the display name with a link to the repo

- "The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for
the current search."
  - Try updating the function triggered after form submission such that it
  clears html in the list div.
